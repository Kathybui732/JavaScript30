    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Kathy';
    let name2 = name;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    console.log(players)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)
    // It goes through and changes both, even though we changed team which is the consecutive array, it still went back and referenced the original array and changed the values of that one
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Kathy'
    console.log(players, team2);
    // slice allows us to take a copy of the original array and make changes to it without effecting the original array reference

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Poppy'
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Toki'
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lightning'
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap = person;
    cap.age = 99,
    console.log(person, cap);
    // Doing this we also make a object reference, so when we change the reference, we also change the original.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 92, number: 80 });
    console.log(person, cap2);
    // This way we can change some of the attributes or add new ones to the copied object

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 30;
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // So, when something is nested, you can copy it and change the first layer without it refencing the original object, but if you change the second layer, it will go back and change the second layer of the original object.

    // We can use JSON.stringify(object) to turn this into the hash into a string, and then use JSON.parse to put it back together and it'll be as if it was a brand new unattached object - not protocol, but a way to cheat your way around the nested references.
